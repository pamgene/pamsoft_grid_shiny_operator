# pamsoft_grid_shiny_operator

Visualizes grids of images. Scroll through the images by clicking on the grid button. Placement of grids can be corrected in two ways:

* if the whole grid is misplaced, click on the background to drag the whole grid. 
* if only one spot is misplaced, click on the spot to drag it to the correct place.
The new grid is automatically saved.
When done, click on Run.

Gridding is done by a Shiny operator. When started, always finish it and donâ€™t leave the page, because it will stop and the grids already reviewed will be lost. 


## Versions

* 1.2.2: Bug of not saving replaced spot is resolved.
